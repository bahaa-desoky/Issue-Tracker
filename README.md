# [Issue tracker](https://issue-tracker-full.netlify.app/)

This is a full stack issue tracker application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, Node.js and React). 
It is a light web application that lets users create issue tickets, update them, and eventualy resolve them so that they can keep up-to-date on their projects.
This is currently a work in progress, and new features are continuously being worked on.

The site is deployed [here](https://issue-tracker-full.netlify.app/).

### Current features:
- Create new tickets
- Update existing tickets
- Delete tickets
- Sign up via email or Google OAuth to view your own tickets anywhere


### Works-in-progress:
- ~~Implement sign-in so users can have unique tickets~~
- Admin/regular users
- Add ability for users working on the same project to add comments under tickets

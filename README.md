# Issue tracker

This is a full stack issue tracker application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, Node.js and React). 
It is meant to be a light web application that lets users create issue tickets, update them, and eventualy resolve them so that they can keep up-to-date on their projects.
This is currently a work in progress, and new features are continuously being worked on.

### Current features:
- Create new tickets
- Update existing tickets
- Delete tickets

### Works-in-progress:
- Implement sign-in so users can have unique tickets
- Admin/regular users
- Add comments to existing tickets
